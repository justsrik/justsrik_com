		<h1>Srikanth Sanga</h1>
		<div id="intro">
			<p>I am a web developer, UI developer and a frontend developer who is passionate about interesting design and writing elegant code. I am also a technology enthusiast and aspire to be an entrepreneur and an astronomer. And when i am not thinking about web and techonology you will find me running (Trying to be a marathon runner and Iron man finisher), exploring the topics about Astronomy, learning about human brain and watching movies & listening to music(I watch way more movies than reading books).</P>
			<p>Here is the greatest quote from the book "Do It Anyway"</p>
			<blockquote>
        		<p>“ People are often unreasonable, illogical and self centered;
						Forgive them anyway.
						If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives;
						Be kind anyway.
						If you are successful, you will win some false friends and some true enemies;
						Succeed anyway.
						If you are honest and frank, people may cheat you;
						Be honest and frank anyway.
						What you spend years building, someone could destroy overnight;
						Build anyway.
						If you find serenity and happiness, they may be jealous;
						Be happy anyway.
						The good you do today, people will often forget tomorrow;
						Do good anyway.
						Give the world the best you have, and it may never be enough;
						Give the world the best you've got anyway.
						You see, in the final analysis, it is between you and your God;
						It was never between you and them anyway. 
				 		” <strong>Dr. Kent M. Keith</strong></p>

		<h1>FROM THE BLOG</h1>
		<div id="blog-posts">
				<p>As this is my first blog post and as i havent created a seprate page for my blog so for now i will write my first post in here and as i have to write something i thought why not share some quotes which i like the most
				<blockquote>
        		<p>“ Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. 
				 ” <strong>Steve Jobs</strong></p>
				 <p>“ If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea. 
				 ” <strong>Antoine de Saint Exupéry</strong></p>
				<p>“ Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through. ” <strong>Ira Glass</strong></p>
